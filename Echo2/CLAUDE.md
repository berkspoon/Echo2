# Echo 2.0 — CRM for Aksia

## Project Overview
Echo 2.0 is a purpose-built CRM system for Aksia, an investment management and advisory firm. It replaces the current Microsoft Power Apps-based "Echo" platform. The PRD (Echo_2.0_PRD_v1.0.docx) is the source of truth for all product decisions.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Templating:** Jinja2 (server-side HTML — no frontend framework)
- **Frontend interactivity:** HTMX (loaded via CDN), Alpine.js (loaded via CDN)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN — no build step, no Node.js)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) via supabase-py
- **Authentication:** Microsoft Entra ID SSO via MSAL (dev stub until SSO wired up)
- **Hosting:** Railway
- **No Node.js. No npm. No React. No Next.js. No frontend build pipeline of any kind.**

## Two Business Lines
1. **Advisory / Discretionary / Research** — relationship-driven, institutional clients. Pipeline: Leads → Contracts. Revenue metric: FLAR (base advisory fees only).
2. **Products / ACPM** — fundraising for commingled funds. Pipeline: Leads with `lead_type='fundraise'|'product'`. Funds: APC, CAPIX, CAPVX, HEDGX.

## User Roles & Permissions
| Role | Key Permissions |
|------|----------------|
| Admin | Full access. User/role/field management, audit log, duplicate merge. |
| Legal | View all. Create/edit Contracts only. |
| RFP Team | Standard access + RFP Hold toggle on Organizations. |
| BD | Standard access + lead ownership. |
| Standard User | CRUD on Orgs, People, Activities, Leads. No Contracts, RFP Hold, or hard-delete. |
| Read Only | View and export only. |

- Multi-role system via `user_roles` junction table. Permissions additive. 6 system roles (cannot delete/rename).
- `require_role()` checks `any(r in allowed_roles for r in user.roles)`
- Currently using dev stub user — SSO awaiting IT app registration.

## Database Rules — Always Follow
- Soft deletes only: `is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`. Never SQL DELETE. Always filter `WHERE is_deleted = FALSE`.
- Audit every field change to `audit_log` table.
- Dropdown values NEVER hardcoded — always from `reference_data` table by category.
- Every table has `id UUID`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`.

## Key Business Logic — Always Follow
- **Do Not Contact:** Auto-remove from all distribution lists + suppress from sends.
- **RFP Hold:** Suppress org's contacts from DL send previews (not removed from lists).
- **L2 superset of L1:** L2 publication list members auto-receive L1 content.
- **Lead → Contract:** Manual creation only (no auto-promotion). "Create Contract" button on Won leads.
- **Coverage:** Stored at Contact + Lead level. Org page shows read-only rollup.
- **Lead Types:** `lead_type` discriminates advisory/fundraise/product. Stages scoped via `parent_value`.
- **Next Steps Date:** Auto-generates Task assigned to lead owner.
- **Activity Follow-Up:** Auto-generates Task. Assignee selectable. Follow-up notes required when enabled.

## Coding Standards
- FastAPI dependency injection for auth on every route
- All DB queries through `db/client.py` — never import supabase directly
- Use `db/helpers.py` shared helpers — never duplicate audit/resolve functions
- Use `form_service.py` for forms, `grid_service.py` + `build_grid_context()` for lists
- HTMX: return partials when `HX-Request` header present, full pages otherwise
- Route ordering: static paths (`/new`, `/my-tasks`) BEFORE `/{id}` catch-all

## Key Architecture

### Dynamic Forms (`services/form_service.py`)
All 6 entity forms render from `field_definitions`. Functions: `build_form_context()`, `parse_form_data()`, `validate_form_data()`, `save_record()`. Visibility rules: `when`/`equals`/`in`/`not_in`/`min_stage`/`lead_type`. Suggestion rules for amber-highlighted fields.

### Reusable Grid (`services/grid_service.py`)
All 7 entity list pages use `build_grid_context()`. Features: entity-aware query/filter/sort/pagination, batch enrichment (no N+1), virtual columns (`_VIRTUAL_COLUMNS`), admin-created linked fields, screeners (saved views), per-column filters (`cf_*` URL params), bulk edit/delete, Excel export, column resizing.

### Admin Panel (`routers/admin.py`)
7 sections: Fields, Layouts, Views, Roles, Users, Reference Data (inline on fields), Duplicates.

### View Configurations (`db/view_config_service.py`)
Admin-configurable settings for DL filters, dashboard table columns, group-by/metric options, grid defaults. 13 seed configs across 3 categories (distribution_lists, dashboards, grids). TTL-cached (60s), validated on save, audit-logged, resettable to defaults. Admin UI at `/admin/views` with visual builders (column, option list, grid picker, DL filter editor).

### Schema Design
- Hybrid EAV: `field_definitions` (metadata) + `entity_custom_values` (typed value columns). Core columns on entity tables for performance.
- `reference_data`: composite unique `(category, value)` with `parent_value` for subtypes.
- Person ↔ Org: many-to-many via `person_organization_links` with link_type + date tracking.
- Tasks + Tags: polymorphic via `record_type` + `record_id`.
- Distribution lists: `l2_superset_of` self-FK, `list_mode` (static/dynamic), `filter_criteria` JSONB.
- Leads: `lead_type` discriminator. Fund_prospects table kept as legacy backup only.
- `pg_trgm` for fuzzy duplicate detection. Full-text search on activities.

## Build Status
All core modules complete. Phases 0–6 done. Outstanding:
- [ ] SSO / Auth (Microsoft Entra ID — awaiting IT app registration)
- [ ] Data migration (scope TBD — awaiting Miles/Admin team)
- [ ] Deferred: multi-tenant, generic calculated fields admin, duplicate merge, editable Excel-style grid

## Open Items (from PRD Section 15)
1. Entra ID Tenant ID + SSO app registration — IT
2. Ostrako NDA export format — Ostrako/IT
3. Authorized senders for publication lists — Marketing
4. Declined reason codes for Fundraise Leads — Product
5. Offshore feeder fund DL structure — Product/IR
6. Soft Circle vs Hard Circle logic — Product
7. Management dashboard access list — Leadership
8. Audit log access beyond Admins — Leadership
9. Data migration scope — Miles/Admin
10. Events management spec — Aggeliki/Marketing
11. CRM name — Leadership
12. crm.aksia.com DNS — IT
13. Railway deployment config — Miles/IT

## Dev Workflow
```bash
cd echo2 && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
**Windows:** Always kill ALL python.exe processes before restarting (`taskkill /F /IM python.exe`). Windows allows multiple processes on the same port — a fresh uvicorn succeeding does NOT mean old servers are gone.
